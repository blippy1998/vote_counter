# vote_counter
counts votes for the Mu Alpha Theta elections, using IRV + approval tie-breaking

to use:

1. use the associated google form to collect the votes

2. after all the votes are collected, download the spreadsheet in .tsv format

3. open a command-line window in the directory of the script (in windows, there's an option for this that comes up if you shift-right click in the directory)

4. type "py -3 votecounter.py" without quotes and press enter

5. follow the instructions (note: if you downloaded the spreadsheet into the directory the script is in, you only need to type the filename rather than the full filepath)
